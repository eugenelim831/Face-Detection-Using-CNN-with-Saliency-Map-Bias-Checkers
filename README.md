# Face-Detection-Using-CNN-with-Saliency-Map-Bias-Checkers
The UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face image repository covering a wide range of ages, genders, and races. Each image is labeled with three attributes: age (0–116), gender (0 = male, 1 = female), and race (0 = White, 1 = Black, 2 = Asian, 3 = Indian, 4 = Others, e.g. Hispanic, Latino, Middle Eastern). Timestamps of when the images were collected are also provided.
The dataset contains around 20,000 “in-the-wild” face images, meaning each image includes a single face captured in unconstrained conditions. The faces exhibit diverse variations in pose, facial expression, lighting, occlusion, and resolution. This diversity is intended to reduce overrepresentation of specific conditions, although this is validated during the data exploration phase. Facial landmarks are detected using a standard keypoint-based algorithm, and the faces are cropped to 200 × 200 pixels, which helps remove background noise and reduce variability unrelated to the face itself.
